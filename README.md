The game provides a series of underscores representing the letters in the movie title, and players must guess individual letters to reveal the hidden word.  
With each correct guess, the hidden letters are unveiled, while incorrect guesses lead to the display of "Shrugman🤷‍♂️" represented as ASCII art.
